# Audio DSP Basics

This repository provides a foundational exploration of audio signal
processing for speech and audio machine learning systems.

It focuses on loading audio, extracting time–frequency representations,
and visualizing the features commonly used by speech-to-text, text-to-speech,
and audio generation models.

## Example Output

### Waveform
![Waveform](waveform.png)

### Mel Spectrogram
![Mel Spectrogram](mel_spectrogram.png)

The waveform shows the raw audio signal in the time domain.

The mel spectrogram shows the time–frequency representation used by
speech and audio generation models.
