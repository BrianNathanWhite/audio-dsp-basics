# Audio DSP Basics

This repository provides a foundational exploration of audio digital signal
processing (DSP) for speech and audio machine learning systems.

It focuses on loading audio, extracting time–frequency representations,
and visualizing the features commonly used by speech-to-text, text-to-speech,
and audio generation models.

## Example Output

The waveform shows the raw audio signal in the time domain.

The mel spectrogram shows the time–frequency representation used by
speech and audio generation models.
